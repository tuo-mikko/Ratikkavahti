# Ratikkavahti
This is a small project of mine that helps the user to check out the arrival times of trams at the 4 nearest stops to them. I often miss the tram by minutes, so I wanted to create a quick and easy way to check when the tram would be arriving. I plan to use React, Node, MongoDB and Express. 

Right now, it is a backend that uses the Journeys API to get find public transport stops near the user geolocation, filter the tram stops and finally fetch the arrival times of trams coming to those stops.

Next, I plan to create a frontend with React just to display the arrival times, based on the design found in my "Designs" repository.

After I have finished working on that, I will implement a search function for all the public transport stops within Tampere municipality.
